# Signal Protocol Manager

This project demonstrates an object‑oriented, modular approach to integrating the [@privacyresearch/libsignal-protocol-typescript](https://github.com/privacyresearch/libsignal-protocol-typescript) library. It encapsulates key generation, session creation, and message encryption/decryption using the Signal Protocol.

## Overview

The main component is the `SignalProtocolManager` class which provides methods to:

- **Generate a Pre-Key Bundle:**  
  Create a new key bundle (identity key pair, registration ID, pre-key, and signed pre-key) using the Signal library.

- **Initialize the Local Store:**  
  Store our identity keys, registration ID, and pre-keys in a local `SignalProtocolStore` (a custom implementation for this demo).

- **Create a Session:**  
  Build a session with a remote user using our own pre-key bundle and the remote user’s pre-key bundle. This returns a `SessionCipher` which can be used for encrypting and decrypting messages.

- **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages:**  
  Use the session to encode (encrypt) plaintext messages and decode (decrypt) received messages.

A demo function (`initDemo`) simulates a message exchange between two users (Alice and Bob) by creating their key bundles, establishing sessions, and exchanging an encrypted message.

## Project Structure

- **`SignalProtocolManager.ts`:**  
  Contains the main class along with helper methods for key generation, store initialization, session creation, message encoding, and message decoding.

- **`store.ts`:**  
  A custom implementation of the Signal protocol store. (Ensure this is implemented according to your project requirements.)

- **`initDemo()` Function:**  
  A demo that simulates the exchange of a message between two instances of `SignalProtocolManager`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v12+ recommended)
- **TypeScript**
- **@privacyresearch/libsignal-protocol-typescript** library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

To run the demo and see a simulated message exchange between two users:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see logs in your console that display:

- Key bundle generation for both users.
- Session creation for Alice and Bob.
- The original plaintext message.
- The encrypted message.
- The decrypted message (which should match the original).

## How It Works

1. **Key Generation:**  
   The `generatePreKeyBundle()` method creates a new pre‑key bundle that includes identity keys, a registration ID, a pre-key, and a signed pre-key.

2. **Store Initialization:**  
   The `initializeStore()` method stores your identity key, registration ID, and pre-keys in the local `SignalProtocolStore`.

3. **Session Creation:**  
   The `createSession()` method initializes the store with your bundle and creates a session with a remote user using their bundle. It saves the remote identity in the store and processes the remote pre-key bundle to generate a session.

4. **Message Encryption/Decryption:**  
   - `encodeMessage()` takes a plaintext string, converts it to an ArrayBuffer, and encrypts it using a `SessionCipher`.
   - `decodeMessage()` takes the encrypted message (with its type and body) and decrypts it back to a string.

## Extensibility

This design follows a modular and object‑oriented approach, making it easy to extend and maintain. You can:
- Split each class into separate files.
- Replace the in-memory store with a persistent solution.
- Integrate this manager into a larger application (e.g., a chat application with end‑to‑end encryption).
